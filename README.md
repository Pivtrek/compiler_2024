Simple Imperative Language Compiler
Project Overview

This project is a compiler for a simple imperative language, built using Java and ANTLR4. The compiler translates source code into an assembly-like language for a custom virtual machine. It supports variable management, arithmetic operations, control structures, loops, procedures, and memory handling.
Features

âœ… Full Compilation Pipeline

    Lexical and syntactic analysis using ANTLR4
    Semantic analysis with symbol table management
    Code generation for a custom stack-based virtual machine

âœ… Memory Management

    Stack-based variable allocation
    Handling global, local, and procedural variables
    Array indexing and iterator support

âœ… Control Structures & Loops

    IF, IF-ELSE, WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR loops
    Efficient condition evaluation

âœ… Arithmetic & Optimizations

    Optimized multiplication and division using binary algorithms
    Strength reduction (replacing expensive operations with simpler ones)
    Loop invariant code motion (reducing redundant calculations)

âœ… Procedure Handling

    Nested procedure calls
    Parameter passing (by reference)
    Stack-based return address management

âœ… Error Handling

    Detection of uninitialized variables
    Prevention of undeclared identifiers
    No recursion allowed (per language specification)

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites

    Java 19+
    Maven

Build Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

Compile the project:

mvn clean package

This generates a standalone JAR file in the target/ directory.
Usage

To compile a program written in this language, use:

java -jar target/kompilator.jar <input_file> <output_file>

Example:

java -jar target/kompilator.jar examples/program.imp output.mr

This will generate an assembly-like output file (output.mr) that can be run on the virtual machine.

Known Issues & Improvements

ðŸ”¹ Handling large numbers: Current implementation is limited to standard integer operations.
ðŸ”¹ Further optimizations: Additional instruction merging and register reuse could improve efficiency.
ðŸ”¹ Better debugging tools: Improved error reporting and debugging support could be added.
